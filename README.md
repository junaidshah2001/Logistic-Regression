# Logistic-Regression
This repository contains a hands-on implementation of **Logistic Regression with Regularization**, inspired by Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera.

This project implements **Logistic Regression from scratch in Python**, based on Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization (Week 3). It includes the full pipeline: sigmoid function, loss function, cost function, and gradient descent — with **L2 regularization** to combat overfitting.

📘 **Notebook**: `C1_W3_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`  
📚 **Course**: Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI (Andrew Ng)

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

✅ How logistic regression models work for binary classification  
✅ Role of the **sigmoid function** in mapping predictions to probabilities  
✅ How to compute **cross-entropy loss** and overall **cost**  
✅ How to use **gradient descent** to optimize model parameters  
✅ How **regularization (L2)** improves generalization and reduces overfitting  
✅ Clean and vectorized NumPy implementations
